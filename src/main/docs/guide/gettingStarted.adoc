In this guide, we are going to do a deep dive into http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices[GORM Data Services]. Introduced in GORM 6.1,
GORM Data Services take the work out of implemented service layer logic by adding the ability to
automatically implement abstract classes or interfaces using GORM logic. It results in less code to write, compile time optimization, and ease of testing.

This guide will go into detail on how to create and use GORM Data Services with a sample Grails application.  The guide will stay focused on the
service layer of the app consistent with persistence.
