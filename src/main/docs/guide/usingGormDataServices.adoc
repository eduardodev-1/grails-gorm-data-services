To write a Data Service, create an interface and annotate it with `grails.gorm.services.Service` with the applied domain class.
The `@Service` transformation looks at the method signatures of the interface to surmise what implementation should be generated.
It looks at the return type along with the method stem to implement functionality. See
http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#_data_service_queries[here] for details.
