Data Services can also implement a join query using the `grails.gorm.services.Join` annotation.
Grails associations are lazily loaded by default. For a one to many relationship, loading
of the many side can cause https://dzone.com/articles/hibernate-gorm-solving-the-n1-problem[n + 1] problems resulting in
many select statements. This can severely hinder performance.

Essentially we can perform an eager load with `@Join`. Apply this to concept to a query on `Person` and `Address`.

Until this point we have defined the Person GORM Data Service with an interface. You can use an abstract class instead.
A combination of interface and an abstract class implementing the interface with some custom methods is a common pattern. Rewrite
`PersonDataService` as shown below:

    void delete(Serializable id)

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/PersonDataService.groovy[tag=save]

}

Create an integration test:

[source, groovy]
.src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/PersonDataServiceIntSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/PersonDataServiceIntSpec.groovy[tag=clazz]

include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/PersonDataServiceIntSpec.groovy[tag=findEagerly]

}
----

<1> Place your integration tests in `src/integration-test` and annotate them with `grails.testing.mixin.integration.Integration`.
<2> Inject the Data Service.

In order to observe how Data Service operations translate into SQL statements, we will adjust the logger configuration.

In the `logback.groovy`, append the next line line to get a more verbose output of the SQL queries being executed:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/logback.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/logback.groovy[tag=hqlLogger]
----

Execute the integration test `./gradlew integrationTest --tests example.grails.PersonDataServiceIntSpec`

The previous tests outputted SQL log statement which demonstrates a join has been issued. Below is a sample.

[source, bash]
.log output

As you can see only one select query is performed. A query which joins the addresses.

You can see those statements in the tests reports `build/reports/tests/classes/example.grails.PersonDataServiceIntSpec.html` standard output.
