Data Services can also implement a join query using the `grails.gorm.services.Join` annotation.  For  a one to many relationship, loading
of the many side can cause https://dzone.com/articles/hibernate-gorm-solving-the-n1-problem[n + 1] problems resulting in
many select statements.  This can severely hinder performance.

Essentially we can perform an eager load with `@Join`. Apply this to concept to a query on `Person` and `Address`.

This time around create an integration test. Inject the Data Service.

Note the outputted SQL log statement which demonstrates a join has been issued. Below is a sample.
