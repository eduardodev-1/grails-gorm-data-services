If you have worked with GORM in the past, it is probable that you have you used http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#finders[Dynamic Finders] to query.

____
A dynamic finder looks like a static method invocation, but the methods themselves donâ€™t actually exist in any form at the code level.
Instead, a method is auto-magically generated using code synthesis at runtime, based on the properties of a given class
____


With GORM Data Services, you can create an interface with methods with the same expressiveness as Dynamic Finders but
without the disadvantages. E.g. you get type safety since GORM Data services are statically compiled.

To find a `Person` by name with a Dynamic finder you will use
`Person.findByName`. Let's implement a Data Service to achieve the same query.

Create an interface annoated with `import grails.gorm.services.Service` and declare a method with the same signature.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/example/grails/PersonDataService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/PersonDataService.groovy[tag=packageDeclaration]

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/PersonDataService.groovy[tag=serviceImport]

@Service(Person) // <1>
interface PersonDataService {

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/PersonDataService.groovy[tag=findByName]

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/PersonDataService.groovy[tag=count]

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/PersonDataService.groovy[tag=delete]

}
----

<1> Qualify the `@Service` with the domain class you want to use.
<2> In the method `findByName`, the stem is `find` which tells GORM it's a query (thus a read-only transaction will be used), and `Name` matches the domain property.
<3> The method `delete` takes the `id` of the person which should be removed. It will automatically be wrapped in a writable transaction.
