Automatic implementation of an interface or an abstract class reduces the amount of code written.  In
addition, GORM Data Services define transaction boundary semantics automatically.  For example, all public methods are made
marked with `@Transaction` (and read-only for query methods).

=== Advantages of Data Services

To summarize the advantages:

- *Type Safety* - Data service method signatures are compile time checked and compilation will fail if the types of any
parameters don’t match up with properties in your domain class.

- *Testing* - Since Data Services are interfaces this makes them easy to mock.

- *Performance* - The generated services are statically compiled and unlike competing technologies in the Java space no
proxies are created so runtime performance doesn’t suffer.

- *Transaction Management* - Each method in a Data Service is wrapped in an appropriate transaction (a read-only transaction
in the case of read operations) that can be easily overridden.
